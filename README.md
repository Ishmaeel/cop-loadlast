# CoP LoadLast
Main menu modification for [S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:_Call_of_Pripyat)

This micro mod adds a "**Last Save**" menu item to the top of the main menu, which loads the latest save game with a single keypress. 

*It also probably has a feature that crashes the game nicely when there are no save games present (untested).*

Should be compatible with vanilla and [AtmosFear 3](https://www.moddb.com/mods/atmosfear-for-call-of-pripyat/downloads/atmosfear-3-for-cop) mod.

Compatibility with any other mods or versions have not been tested.

Commit history includes the original files from vanilla (1.6.02) so you can see exactly what has been changed and merge the changes by yourself if necessary.
